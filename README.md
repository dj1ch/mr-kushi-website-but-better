Their original website is horrible looking. This one is way better. 

#### Original link to the original website: 
[mr-kushi.eboard.com](url)

## How to open?
1. Push the code button.
2. From there, there should be a "Download ZIP" button. Click that to download it
3. Extract it by right clicking it in the file app and clicking a button that says "Extract here" or something similar.
4. There should be a folder called "mr-kushi-website-but-better" where you extracted that file
5. Click into that folder and click the file called "index.html"
6. That file is the actual front page of the website, and the other ones are just pages on it.

### Note:
The website in the description is not the actual website. I will host it on one of my computers in a couple weeks or so...
