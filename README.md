# Mr. Kushi's website but better!
Their original website is horrible looking. This one is way better. Mine is hosted here on github, and is maintained by myself and the community.
#
### Updates
Updates should be every day around 5-8 PM PST
###
### Features:
- Simple and easy to navigate UI
- Download links from the original site
- Not very colorful, for the sake of simplicity and ease of navigation
- Text from the website is simplified for readability using AI
